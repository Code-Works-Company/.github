## üöÄ Our Projects

We‚Äôve worked on several impactful projects, each designed to address specific needs within our community:

### 1. **VISCA Website**
A dynamic and interactive map that displays updated information on international schools in Hanoi, including counseling data. It automates data fetching from a Google Sheet to ensure up-to-date information is always available. Check it out here: https://visca.netlify.app/

### 2. **Concordia Events Management App**
An app designed to streamline the organization and promotion of events at Concordia International School. It provides features for event registration, scheduling, and reminders, making it easy for students and staff to stay informed and engaged with school activities.

### 3. **Concordia Hanoi Mobile App**
Our team members have actively worked on and contributed to the official mobile app for Concordia International School Hanoi!

### 4. **Operation Thunder Coin**
